#### A fun dice-rolling game.

#### By **Nathan Ng'ethe**

## Description
Pig-dice is a deeply engrossing game whereby the player rolls a dice and continues rolling until he/she decides to hold the aggregate score, or the dice lands on a one and the player's entire score is nullified. Hope you enjoy playing the game.

## Features
* Rules - the player is supposed to read this before starting the game so as to understand the game-flow. However, if you need to clarify on some rules while in the middle of your game you can click the help icon at the top right of the game page.

* Roll & Hold buttons - use these to roll the dice until you get to a desired mark whereby you can hold the die and the score is added to your total score.

* New Game - use this icon to reset the game if you wish to start all over again.

## Demo

## Setup instructions
The game is only available for online access but in the future I plan to have it available for offline access.

## Technologies used
- [HTML & CSS]() - I used html to make the backbone of the game and CSS to style various elements inthe HTML document.
- [Bootstrap]() - This acts as a framework especiallly when it comes to positioning elements in the game.
- [Javascript]() - Javascript is the main component when it comes to the game's functionality. I also used [jQuery]() as a library.
